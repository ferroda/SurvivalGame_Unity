# This is my first attempt in Unity3D. 
This is a Survival game, where you can walk around the field (terrain) with a first-person character, I’ve created the graphical side of the game using Unity game engine. For realistic I’ve used stamina, vitality, hunger and thirst what is display for the gamer in the left of the screen (this is the status of the character), I have created a day and night cycle, furthermore there is a tree-cutting system in the game. 
You can find almost anything in the field, I’ve created mountains (but its not so easy to climb on the top), hills, river, forrest, fires (this is a point what orientate your character in the dark night). There are some things, that can decrease the vitality of the character, for example: walking in the fire or falling in the sea or river. 

I’ve used C# .Net for creating the frame of the game. You can find it in the Scripts folder. I tried not to break the SOLID principles as much as I can. There are a lot of possibilities for development. For mention I would like build in an inventory section, animals (hunting fuctions) and of course different difficulty fields and real gameover when the character lost his vitality. 

You can visualize the whole field (terrain) in developer mode, if you open it in Unity3D.
